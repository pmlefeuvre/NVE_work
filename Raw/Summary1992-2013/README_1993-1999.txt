This text file gathers all the manual edits made to the Raw files 
collected before 1999. A summary of all data exists in RAWDATA_SUM.xls.
The names of the files (I got compared to the summary) differ by not 
having capital letters and are written "data" insead of "DATA".

1992:
	- data001.dat: Removed unknown data and kept LC data within the first 14 lines (Before 344 10:00). To get continuity in the data, I added two lasts empty columns between 344 05:00 and 344 13:00 as well as one last empty column between 344 14:00 and 346 12:00. Then I added one column to the rest of the data with$ cat data001.dat | sed 's/^M/,^M/' > /tmp/data001.dat; mv /tmp/data001.dat data001.dat
I had to remove ^M:
$ for i in Ordered/*.dat; do cat $i | sed 's/^M//' > /tmp/${i##*/}; mv /tmp/${i##*/} $i; done
	- Data from 1993 were deleted from data001.dat

1993:
	- Data from 1992 were deleted from data001.dat
	- data0[09-18].dat: Removed unknown data and kept LC data in the whole file. Quite a volume of none LC data. I also deleted file data014.dat because there was no LC data.
	- data0[29-31].dat, data0[33-39].dat, data041.dat and data043.dat were deleted (Niel's data)
	- data040.dat I added two empty columns (i.e. ",,") to keep coherence in the file despite the rewiring (see RAWDATA_SUM.xls)
	- Extracted LC data (from Niel Iversons') from files (data0[48,49,51,53,54,55,57,58,60-62].dat) with this code: 
$ for i in 48 49 51 53 54 55 57 58 60 61 62;
$ do awk -F, -v OFS=, '{if ($1==211) print $0}' ../Raw_Backup/data0$i.dat  > data0$i.dat
$ done
	- data0[50,52,56,59,63-69,72-75].dat were deleted because no LC data

1994:
	- data0[76-79,82,84].dat were deleted because no LC data
	- Extracted LC data from files (data0[80,81].dat) with this code: 
$ for i in 81 82;do awk -F, -v OFS=, '{if ($1==211) print $0}' ../Raw_Backup/data0$i.dat  > data0$i.dat; done

> OLD was also removing time when equal to 0 (midnight)
$ cat ../Raw_BackUp/data098.dat | sed 's/,0,/,-99999,/g' | sed 's/,0,/,-99999,/g' | awk -F, -v OFS=, '{if ($9~0) $9=-99999; else if ($9==0) $9=-99999}{ print $0}' > data098.dat
