Work: 	 Reorganising Raw data

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In "Raw_copy", The files are original and not modified. They come from
NVE's Archive ("diverse gammel/trykkdata" or something like that). 
I have reorganised them:
- placing Raw data with extension ".dat" or ".DAT" in the folder "Raw"
- placing Raw data with extension ".txt" in the folder "Raw txt"
- placing Raw data that had ambiguities according to NVE's DataLists, 
  that I obtained, in the folder "Raw_{YEAR}"

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Modifications:

In each folder "Raw", I only kept data from the year of the folder. 
=> Removal of previous and next year data in the raw files, because 
a problem arises if the files are merged and sorted. It is going to
mix different years.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Folder "1999"
=> I have added to "1999/Raw" Gaute's compiled file "1999.dat" and renamed
it "FromGaute'sBackup_1999.dat"

- Folder "2000"
=> I have added to "2000/Raw" Gaute's compiled file "Compiled_2000.csv" and
converted it into"FromGaute'sBackupCompiled_2000.dat"

- Folder "2001"
=> I have added to "2001/Raw" 2 text files "MAR20001.txt" &
"MAR30001.txt" (79 - 89) and converted them into ".dat".
=> Because the file "2001_sep-des_15.dat" was missing, I have added 
to "2001/Raw" the Excel file "DEC3101.xls" and converted it in ".dat".
This file has the same time span according to the DataList.
cmd: xls2csv -x DEC3101.xls | sed "s/\"//g" > Raw/DEC3101.dat | chmod u+x

- Folder "2002"
=> I have added to "2002/Raw" 12 text files: 
Data02_0227.txt  Data02_0417.txt  Data02_0705a.txt Data02_0706b.txt
Data02_0228.txt  Data02_0419.txt  Data02_0705b.txt Data02_0707.txt
Data02_0406.txt  Data02_0420.txt  Data02_0706a.txt Data02_0731.txt 
and converted into ".dat". (1-59)
=> The file Data02_0705b contains weird data (maybe pump test) which have
a sampling rate < 1min. (103 11:45 - 103 14:05) I removed them and saved
the data in a new file: Data02_0705b_edited.dat

Creation of a directory "Correction_trykk_marsXXX" & a bash code that apply
date correction, compile results and copy them to the directory "Raw".
"trykk_oct023.dat" was also converted from tab-separated to comma-separated.

- Folder "2010"
=> I removed data from 2009 in the file "trykk_13mar002.dat" 
=> I added "trykk_31mar001.dat" (2009-2010) to "Raw" & "Raw_copy"
